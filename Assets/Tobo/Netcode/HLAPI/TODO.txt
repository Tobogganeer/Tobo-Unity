HLAPI TODO:
NetworkObject: Stores the scene/net/asset ID. Has an owner and manages messages/rpcs for NetworkBehaviours. Spawns automatically. Can be serialized.
NetworkPrefabManager: Stores all prefabs that can be spawned over the network. Possibility to specify different versions for local and remote objects (useful for players)
NetworkBehaviour: Replacement for Monobehaviour. Comes with some net-specific callbacks/virtual fns. Can be serialized (array in NetworkID)
NetworkTransform: Syncs the transform over the network. Let the owner do the syncing OR server control only.
NetworkAnimator: Wrapper for Animator that networks the calls.
